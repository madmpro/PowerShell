#PowerShell
### My personal PowerShell configuration

Which resides here to enable rapid deployment on new systems or alien hardware environments, to make them more "homey."

Outsiders will most likely be more interested in my PowerShell profile, whose structure implements quite a number of techniques that I've stolen from others over the years, but which *most of the time* demonstrates reasonably sound practices and a maintainable structure overall.  (Some things get out of hand -- like inline functions, *e.g.* -- but in general it's a good design.)

Otherwise, a casual observer may be interested in which modules I find worthwhile (always a rich vein to harvest in others' profiles).

### To use this repo:

1. If you like, fork it first and then
2. Simply clone it to ~/Documents/WindowsPowerShell

Forking has the advantage of enabling your own variant of this repo without reliance on mine, but isn't strictly necessary.  Clone away, and devil d*mn the torpedoes.
