Bulk Renaming Files
 
Let's assume you have a folder full of picture files, and you'd like 
to standardize naming.

Here is a script illustrating how you can do a bulk rename: 
 
$i = 0 
 
Get-ChildItem -Path c:\pictures -Filter *.jpg | 
ForEach-Object {
    $extension = $_.Extension
    $newName = 'pic_{0:d6}{1}' -f  $i , $extension 
    $i++ 
    Rename-Item -Path $_.FullName -NewName $newName 
} 
 
All JPG files in the picture folder are renamed. The new name is "pic_" 
and a six digit number.

You can easily adjust the script to rename other file types, or use 
another file name template.
