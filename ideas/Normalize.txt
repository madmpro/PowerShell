Normalizing Line Endings

When you download files from the Internet, you may run into situations 
where the file wonâ€™t open correctly in editors. Most likely, this is 
caused by non-default line endings.

Here is an example of such a problem. In a previous tip we showed you 
how to download a MAC address vendor list. When you do that and open 
the file in the Notepad, all line breaks are gone:

$url = 'http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/oui/oui.txt'
$outfile = "$home\vendorlist.txt"

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $outfile

Invoke-Item -Path $outfile 

To repair the file, simply use this code:
$OldFile = "$home\vendorlist.txt"
$NewFile = "$home\vendorlistGood.txt"

Get-Content $OldFile | Set-Content -Path $NewFile

notepad $NewFile 
Get-Content is capable of identifying even non-standard line breaks, 
so the result is a string array of lines. When you write these back 
to a new file, then all is good because Set-Content will use default 
line endings.
